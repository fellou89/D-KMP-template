/* INITALIZATION BEHAVIOUR (two UI recompositions):
when a screen is first navigated to, using "dkmpNav.navigate(screen,params)", this is what happens in sequence:
1. The navigation function causes the local navigation state to change, causing the FIRST recomposition
2. In the first recomposition, the screen is shown in its "initState" (which typically includes "isLoading=true", showing a "loading..." message)
3. After the first recomposition, the function defined in "callOnInit" is called, which typically loads the data from the Repository
4. The "callOnInit" function, after retrieving the data, typically calls "stateManager.updateScreen()", which updates the state and hence triggers the SECOND recomposition */
